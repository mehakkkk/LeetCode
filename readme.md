Description
A string can be shortened by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths (without leading zeros).

For example, the string "implementation" can be abbreviated in several ways, such as:

"i12n" -> ("i mplementatio n")
"imp4n5n" -> ("imp leme n tatio n")
"14" -> ("implementation")
"implemetation" -> (no substrings replaced)
Invalid abbreviations include:

"i57n" -> (i mplem entatio n, adjacent substrings are replaced.)
"i012n" -> (has leading zeros)
"i0mplementation" (replaces an empty substring)
You are given a string named word and an abbreviation named abbr, return true if abbr correctly abbreviates word, otherwise return false.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:

Input: word = "apple", abbr = "a3e"

Output: true
Example 2:

Input: word = "international", abbr = "i9l"

Output: false
Example 3:

Input: word = "abbreviation", abbr = "abbreviation"

Output: true
Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 100
word is made up of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= abbr.length <= 100
abbr is made up of lowercase English letters and digits.
All digit-only substrings of abbr fit in a 32-bit integer.
